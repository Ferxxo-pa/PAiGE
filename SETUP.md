# PAiGE - Supabase Setup Guide

## Overview
Your PAiGE reading tracker is now upgraded with full authentication and database functionality using Supabase!

## 📋 Setup Steps

### 1. Database Setup
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL schema found in `src/database/schema.sql` to create all necessary tables and security policies

### 2. Environment Variables
The following environment variables are automatically configured through Lovable's Supabase integration:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous key

These are set automatically when you connect Supabase through the green button in Lovable.

### 3. Authentication Setup
Authentication is already configured with:
- ✅ Email/Password sign up and sign in
- ✅ User session management
- ✅ Automatic user profile creation
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- **User Authentication**: Email/password with secure sessions
- **Reading Progress**: Log pages read with persistent storage
- **Streak Tracking**: Automatic calculation of reading streaks
- **Book Management**: Add and track multiple books
- **Reading Sessions**: Detailed tracking of daily reading activity

### Database Tables
- **user_profiles**: User preferences and stats
- **books**: Book library with reading status
- **reading_sessions**: Daily reading activity logs

### Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Users can only access their own data
- **Protected Routes**: Authentication required for all features
- **Secure API calls**: All database operations use Supabase RLS

## 🎯 What's New vs. localStorage Version

### Before (localStorage)
- Data only stored locally
- No user accounts
- Data lost if browser storage cleared
- Single device only

### After (Supabase)
- ✅ Persistent cloud storage
- ✅ User accounts with authentication
- ✅ Cross-device synchronization
- ✅ Secure data with proper permissions
- ✅ Reading sessions tracking
- ✅ Streak calculation from actual data
- ✅ Book library management

## 📱 Usage

1. **First Visit**: Users see a welcome screen with "Start Reading Journey" button
2. **Authentication**: Modal appears for sign up/sign in
3. **Dashboard**: After authentication, users see their personalized dashboard
4. **Data Migration**: Sample data is created for new users
5. **Logging Progress**: "Did you read today?" opens a dialog to input pages
6. **Real-time Updates**: All progress updates immediately reflect in the UI

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Features
- Extend database schema in `src/database/schema.sql`
- Add new hooks in `src/hooks/useReadingData.tsx`
- Create new components following the existing pattern

### Styling
The app maintains your beautiful dark theme with neon accents:
- Colors: Emerald green, zinc backgrounds
- Design: Rounded cards with glassmorphism effects
- Responsive: Works on all screen sizes

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **White screen**: Check if Supabase environment variables are set
2. **Authentication errors**: Verify Supabase project settings
3. **Database errors**: Ensure SQL schema has been run

### Support
- Check Supabase dashboard for error logs
